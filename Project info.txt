-->> The basics of this project are--

• Evaluated the strength of the signal received by a mobile user on a street by MATLAB simulation.
• Used the values for free space loss (Lf), loss due to diffraction (|Fv|), excess path loss (Li) and flat edge model for path loss (Ln), which are encountered by the electromagnetic wave when it progresses in air from source to destination.
• Plotted graphs for the signal strength with respect to distance on the street using to evaluate connectivity using MATLAB.
